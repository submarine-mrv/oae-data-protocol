        description: >-
          The project to which the submitted data belong. A unique project identifier that can be used to link project data across data submissions, and link baseline data to intervention data, for example.

          If no Project ID has been assigned, one may be generated by combining the following fields, as described in Cross-linking Data Sets with Common Identifiers.

          Any method that creates a unique ID that will link all project data (e.g., a project's baseline data to intervention data, and various data submissions within an experiment type) is acceptable.
