          The project to which the submitted data belong. A unique project identifier that can be used to link project data across data submissions, and link baseline data to intervention data, for example.

          If no Project ID has been assigned, one may be generated by combining the following fields, as described in Cross-linking Data Sets with Common Identifiers.

          Any method that creates a unique ID that will link all project data (e.g., a project's baseline data to intervention data, and various data submissions within an experiment type) is acceptable.

          A narrative description of the project. For example, what were the goals of the project? What were the research questions? What were the processes to achieve these goals and answer these questions? Who were the key stakeholders, organizers, project leaders? Was this building off a previous or ongoing project, or is this a new region/experiment/mechanistic study?

          If there are relevant regulatory parameters and/or limits to dosing trials at this location, these may be described here.

        description: >-
          Provide information to help characterize the field site and provide context when interpreting the data. For example, descriptions of tidal patterns, climatological conditions, notable geological characteristics, the geographical and marine setting (coastal, intertidal, island region, sheltered environment), and characteristic meteorological events. If possible based on the file type of this submission, please include useful maps or figures here.

          Links to relevant datasets, cruise reports, etc may be provided here.

          This field is required for co-located operations that potentially impact the project results. If previous or on-going mCDR field operations have occurred in the study domain by any project developer, they may be mentioned here either as a description, and/or if a reference to the study exists in the form of a data set, publication, etc, the DOI or other identifying information should be provided. Please provide direct links to data when available.

      colocated_operations:
        description: >-
          A description is required if any nearby operations exist that may influence the waters over the time period covered by this data. This might be a nearby mCDR project, a facility that discharges water with different characteristics than the inflow (e.g., a desalination plant), frequent boating operations, etc.
