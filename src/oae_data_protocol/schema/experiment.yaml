          Project ID + Experiment type + Optional numerical indicator to differentiate between various experiments of
          the same type for a project. A two digit consecutive number beginning with 01

        title: Experiment Description
        description: >-
          A narrative description of the experiment. For example, what part of the project do these data represent
          (e.g., baseline, intervention, control) and what do they contribute to the overall project? Are all project
          research questions listed in Project description relevant? What were the processes to achieve these goals and
          answer these questions? Data submitters are encouraged to note any significant changes to the original
          experimental plan due to unforeseen circumstances here.

        description: >-
          Project ID must be included in the Experiment-level metadata in order to link all experiments to the main
          project.

          The project to which the submitted data belong. A unique project identifier that can be used to link project
          data across data submissions, and link baseline data to intervention data, for example.

          If no Project ID has been assigned, one may be generated by combining the following fields, as described in
          Cross-linking Data Sets with Common Identifiers.

          Any method that creates a unique ID that will link all project data (e.g., a project's baseline data to
          intervention data, and various data submissions within an experiment type) is acceptable.
