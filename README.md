The [OAE Data Management Protocol](http://carbontosea.org/oae-data-protocol/1-0-0/) outlines recommendations
for producing consistent data and metadata for Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) research projects.

This repository provides machine-readable schemas and data standards for the protocol. It focuses on formal specifications for metadata about OAE projects, experiments, datasets, and individual data variables within datasets themselves (including instrumet, analysis, and calibration metadata).

**For Protocol Compliance**: As of the v1.0 protocol launch (August 25, 2025), projects seeking to comply with the protocol guidelines should use the Excel templates available on the [protocol website](http://carbontosea.org/oae-data-protocol/1-0-0/). These templates are also available in the [`templates/excel`](./templates/excel) directory of this repository.

**Beta Testing**: Organizations and researchers interested in testing the software tooling under development in this repository should contact [data@carbontosea.org](mailto:data@carbontosea.org).

## What's Inside

This repository contains [LinkML](https://linkml.io) schema definitions that can generate:

- **JSON Schema** for data validation and form generation
- **Python dataclasses** for programmatic data handling
- **Documentation** (what you're reading now!)
- Support for multiple serialization formats (JSON, YAML, RDF, etc.)

## Documentation

📖 **[View the schema documentation](https://submarine-mrv.github.io/oae-data-protocol)**

## Quick Start



### Using the Schemas

The generated schemas are available in the `project/` directory:

- `project/jsonschema/` - JSON Schema definitions
- `src/oae_data_protocol/datamodel/` - Python dataclasses

## Repository Structure

```
├── src/
│   └── oae_data_protocol/
│       ├── schema/          # LinkML schema definitions (edit these!)
│       └── datamodel/       # Generated Python dataclasses
├── project/                 # Generated project files (don't edit)
├── examples/                # Example data files
├── tests/                   # Python tests
└── docs/                    # Generated documentation
```

## Development

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/submarine-mrv/oae-data-protocol.git
cd oae-data-protocol

# Install dependencies
make install

# Generate schema artifacts
make gen-project
```

### Common Commands

```bash
make help              # Show all available commands
make gen-project       # Regenerate schemas and Python code
make test             # Run tests
make lint             # Lint LinkML schemas
make serve            # Build and serve documentation locally
```

### Working with Schemas

The schema files in `src/oae_data_protocol/schema/` are the source of truth. Edit these files and run `make gen-project` to regenerate all derived artifacts.

## Project Status 

**Current Status**: Alpha development

We're actively developing and refining these schemas based on real-world usage and community feedback.
Breaking changes may occur as we work toward a stable v1.0 release of these schemas which will have parity
with v1.0.0 of the protocol.
