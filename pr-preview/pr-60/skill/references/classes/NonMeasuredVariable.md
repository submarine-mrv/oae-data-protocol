# NonMeasuredVariable

A contextual or ancillary variable that is NOT directly measured or calculated by the project. Use for identifiers (Cruise_ID, Exp_ID), timestamps (Year_UTC, Time_UTC), coordinates (Latitude, Longitude), and any other data included in the dataset for context. Do NOT create a NonMeasuredVariable for quality control flag columns — instead, set dataset_variable_name_qc_flag on the parent measured or calculated variable that the flag relates to. variable_type must be "non_measured".

| Field | Required | Many | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| variable_type | yes | no | always `non_measured` | High-level classification of the variable. Determines which standard identifiers are available and, combined with genesis and sampling, which schema class to use. |
| schema_class | yes | no | always `NonMeasuredVariable` | The schema class name for this variable (e.g., "DiscretePHVariable"). Auto-populated by the metadata builder. |
| dataset_variable_name | yes | no | string | The name for the variable as it is identified in the dataset data file. This could be the column header in a CSV or the variable name in a NetCDF file. Standard common recommended column header names can be found in protocol documentation [here](https://www.carbontosea.org/oae-data-protocol/1-0-0/#column-header-name). |
| long_name | yes | no | string | Full descriptive name of the variable. |
| units | no | no | string | Unit of measurement for this variable. |
| standard_identifier | no | no | [VocabularyItemReference](VocabularyItemReference.md) | A term from a community vocabulary that identifies this variable. CF standard names (NERC P07) are recommended. |
